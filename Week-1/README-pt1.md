Hey there, it's good to see you.
Your journey towards game development begins from here.<br>
Lets get started!

Link to this week's <a href=""> video.</a> 

Firstly, lets set-up our environment.

<H1><b> Installing Android Studio </H1></b>

 * Download android studio from <a href ="https://developer.android.com/studio/">here.</a>
 * Installation is pretty straight forward.
 * You should hopefully see a welcome screen. Refer <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pHYpXN_a9-4hv4LCv8hvT8I-1GLI-T5G"> this guide </a> for more info.
   <br>FYI: A network connection is needed while setting up for the first time or else you might end up with some IDE errors
 * Further references for <a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio/install">Windows,Linux & Mac.</a>

<h1><b>Setting up the emulator</h1></b>

Emulator is essentially a simulator which creates a virtual device on your PC where you can test your app. It is quite handy as we can 
run our app on various device without the need of having one. More info on how to install and use can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator">here</a><br>
I personally would prefer using a real device here as it is much easier to use.
Check out <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app">this</a> document for how to connect your device and run your app on it.

<h1><b>Downloading LibGDX</h1></b>

* Download executable JAR file from <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html">here</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DGmJ7Wo9DKwIKdz983ILiVxMpS4sgeot">here.</a><br> You may get a warning when downloading but proceed to keep the file anyway.
* Execute the file and keep configurations as shown below.<br><b>Side Note:</b> The game class must not contain any spaces nor special characters.
* Android SDK path can be found in Tools>SDK Manager in android studio
* Hit Generate.

* You are most likely to get a warning stating 'You have a more recent version of build tools than recommended'. Click on Yes
* If all goes well a project file will be generated in the destination folder. Again internet connection is required
* Now go to Android Studio File>Open. Navigate to the location where the file is generated. Click on the project and click OK

You should end up with something like this.

There you go. Your Setup is complete. Go ahead and explore the files and its contents.<br>

<b><u>NOTE:</b></u><br>
* It is very likely that you would end up with many errors and issues as you move forward through this course.
  You might have issues just for setting up the environment. I would address most of the common issues nevertheless but I would add that 
  most of the issues can be solved just by googling it out. You can reach out to me but I would recommend you do some research yourself as
  in the process of searching solution for the problem, you would learn alot
* References and Guides which I will post here might be found overwhelming to you but just focus on the problem. As time goes by, you would 
  get used to it.

<h5><b> Alright then. We are now on our way to build our first game. We have our environment ready, all the tools necessary But...<br>.
   <br>.<br>we have to cover some basics first :(<br>
   Don't worry it won't be long. We'll wizz by it and start our game development asap<br>
   For now, head over to part 2 where we'll brush by some basics of Java<b></h5>
