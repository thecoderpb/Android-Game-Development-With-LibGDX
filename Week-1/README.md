Hey there,Good to see you.
Your journey towards game development begins from here.Lets get started!

Lets set-up our environment first.

<H1><b> Installing Android Studio </H1></b>

 * Download android studio from <a href ="https://developer.android.com/studio/">here.</a>
 * Installation is pretty straight forward
 * You should hopefully see a welcome screen. Refer <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pHYpXN_a9-4hv4LCv8hvT8I-1GLI-T5G"> this guide </a> for more info.
   <br>FYI: A network connection is needed while setting up for the first time or else you might end up with some IDE errors
