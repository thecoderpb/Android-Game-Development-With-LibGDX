Hey there, good to see you.
Your journey towards game development begins from here.
Lets get started!

Firstly, lets set-up our environment.

<H1><b> Installing Android Studio </H1></b>

 * Download android studio from <a href ="https://developer.android.com/studio/">here.</a>
 * Installation is pretty straight forward.
 * You should hopefully see a welcome screen. Refer <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pHYpXN_a9-4hv4LCv8hvT8I-1GLI-T5G"> this guide </a> for more info.
   <br>FYI: A network connection is needed while setting up for the first time or else you might end up with some IDE errors
 * Further references for <a href = "">Windows,Linux & Mac.</a>

<h1><b>Setting up the emulator</h1></b>

Emulator is essentially a simulator which creates a virtual device on your PC where you can test your app. It is quite handy as we can 
run our app on various device without the need of having one. More info about how to install and use can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator">here</a><br>
I personally would prefer using a real device here as it is much easier to use.
Check out <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app">this</a> document for how to connect your device and run your app on it.
